Data Expo 2009 Analysis of Airplane Data to create a report to find useful insights using both Python and R language
The 2009 ASA Statistical Computing and Graphics Data Expo consisted of flight arrival
and departure details for all commercial flights on major carriers within the USA from October 1987 to April 2008. This is a large dataset; there are nearly 120 million records in
total, and it takes up 1.6 gigabytes of space when compressed and 12 gigabytes when uncompressed. The complete dataset, along with supplementary information and variable
descriptions, can be downloaded from the Harvard Dataverse at
https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7
Choose any subset of ten consecutive years and any of the supplementary information
provided by the Harvard Dataverse to answer the following questions using the principles
and tools you have learned in this course:
(a) What are the best times and days of the week to minimize delays each year?
(b) Evaluate whether older planes suffer more delays on a year-to-year basis.
(c) How does the number of people flying between different locations change over
Time?
(d) Can you detect Cascading Delays in one airport create delays in others?
(e) Use the available variables to construct a model that predicts delays.

The dataset we have used is only for two years just because of the extensivity of data, the same codespace can be used for 10 years of data as it has the same building structure  you can say, the available report has all the details, just you have to download the dataset from given link and follow the cleaning process for all the data.
